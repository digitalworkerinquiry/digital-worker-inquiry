      Dr Angelika Strohmayer is co-director of the Design Feminisms Research Group, board member of the Sex Work Research Hub, and interdisciplinary researcher working closely with third sector organisations. She aims to work collaboratively on in-the-world projects that engage people at all stages of the research process to engender change towards more just worlds. To do this, she works across boundaries, bringing together disparate groups to engage in collaborative, justice-oriented, and sometimes digital endeavours. Currently, her research relates to two intertwining areas of inquiry: (1) the relationships between data, technologies, and safety for communities and people who are seldom thought about by industry and researchers alike; and (2) the ways in which digitally augmented textiles practices can create safe spaces for difficult conversations in interpersonal settings as well as for public awareness-raising. In 2021, she published her first book titled ‘Digitally Augmenting Traditional Craft Practices for Social Justice: The Partnership Quilt'. Angelika’s (sometimes award-winning) publications address justice concerns to build on and develop feminist theories. These arguments are usually based on her in-the-world research and are developed in conversation with others such as experts by experience, support workers, or other researchers.
