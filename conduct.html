  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>We're all here for the same reason: to promote worker power and solidarity. <b>This space is built on respect, understanding, kindness and good faith.</b></p>

  <p>Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.</p>

  <p>Be aware of your privileges, including less obvious or invisible hierarchies. Think about how your words, opinions and feelings are influenced and who they might exclude or harm.</p>

  <p>Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:</p>
<li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Unconstructive 'Devil's Advocate' behaviour, intentionally provocative language</li>
